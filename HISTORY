 2005-07-27   	v1    - First public release on http://www.codeproject.com/threads/StackWalker.asp
 2005-07-28   	v2    - Changed the params of the constructor and ShowCallstack(to simplify the usage)
 2005-08-01   	v3    - Changed to use 'CONTEXT_FULL' instead of CONTEXT_ALL (should also be enough)
                      - Changed to compile correctly with the PSDK of VC7.0
                        (GetFileVersionInfoSizeA and GetFileVersionInfoA is
                        wrongly defined: it uses LPSTR instead of LPCSTR as first paremeter)
					  - Added declarations to support VC5/6 without using 'dbghelp.h' - Added a 'pUserData' member to the
						ShowCallstack function and the PReadProcessMemoryRoutine declaration (to pass some user-defined data,
						which can be used in the readMemoryFunction-callback) 2005-08-02   v4
					  - OnSymInit now also outputs the OS-Version by default
					  - Added example for doing an exception-callstack-walking in main.cpp (thanks to owillebo:
